PyTest Understanding:

Intall pytest package - pip3 install pytest



Pytest Naming Conventions

* File names should start or end with “test”, as in test_example.py or example_test.py
* Class name should start with “Test”, as in TestExample
* Test method names should start with “test_”, as in test_example

Advantage over unittest:
1. No just one startup (i.e. setUp funtion) we can use fixtures(@pytest.fixture()) to execute before and after function
2. @pytest.mark.run(order=2) help to run test in order - http://pytest-ordering.readthedocs.io/en/develop/
3. pytest addoption will let us give arguments from command line

Execution option:
	py.test test_mod.py   # run tests in module
	py.test somepath      # run all tests below somepath
	py.test test_module.py::test_method  # only run test_method in test_module

	-s to print statements
	-v verbose

	* Mac having advantage of using "*" charecter to run multiple files
