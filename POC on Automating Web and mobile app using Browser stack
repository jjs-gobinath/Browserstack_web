POC on Automating Web and mobile app using Browser stack:

	1. Understanding browsersatck and how its working - Completed
	2. Created account and understand automation, live, App Automate process - Completed
	3. Understanding local-tetsing - Completed
	4. Created some sample web and mobile scripts which will run from our machine to Browserstack - Compeletd
	5. Loading local application from downloaded (sample - https://startbootstrap.com/templates/sb-admin/) template to check the local server testing.
		* Created local testing environment and executed the code
		* Executed Web, Mobile and local testing by running the local server

Con's:
	1. For live automation we have ony 100 min (each session will run only once) i.e: if we run "Windows 10 - Chrome 80" Just one minite we can run the session and automatically the session will get closed.
	2. To proceed further we need to buy a plan which cost minimum $29/Month 
	3. For parallel testing which is highlight of the browserstack will only comes with the above plan
	4. Each time we run the application via BrowserStack the time counts.
